/*
Code that contains kernels to run on accelerator in parallel. A kernel 
represents the basic unit of executable code. Each kernel will be 
executed on one work item ("pixel") of your parallel task:

1 work item = 1 "pixel" in your image 

A practical application may generate thousands or even millions of 
work-items, but for the simple task of adding 64 numbers, 
eight work-items will suffice. The program file add_numbers.cl 
contains a function called add_numbers that performs this operation. 
Like all kernel functions, it returns void and its name is preceded by 
the __kernel identifier.

The kernel has 64 values to add together and eight work-items with 
which to add them. After each work-item computes its sum of eight 
values, these partial results will be added together to form a sum for 
the entire group. In the end, the kernel will return two sums â€” one for 
each work-group executing the kernel.

group_result <===== sum_buffer

![xOS Demonstrating Multitasking and Window Manager](https://s32.postimg.org/67wznatj9/event2.png)  
xOS is an operating system written for the PC entirely in assembly language. This results in faster execution, smaller program sizes and overall simplicity. The goal of xOS is to be fully functional, yet small and simple.  
#TO-DO List
xOS is still in the early development stages, and many features are missing. The things below are rather high in the to-do list:
* ATA hard disk driver.
* Prevent applications from eating all CPU time.
* Let MTRR write-combining work on real hardware.

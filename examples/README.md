# Miscellaneous Code

# C/C++

Most of the c/c++ demos have a build scripts at the top of them.
So just copy that and run it in bash.  Linking code is macos specific 
for the most part, unfortunately.  Cross platform building is a work in progress.

A starting place for linux and visual studio build scripts can be found in
cpp/make.sh and cpp/win64/make.bat, respectively.

# Python, node, go, web

Most of the python, node, go, and web code should mostly just work, 
given the appropriate libraries and authentication.

The easiest way to see the web stuff is probably by running the server first.

    cd web
    go run SERVE.go
    
But they'll also work by just clicking on the html files.

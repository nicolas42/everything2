keyboard shortcuts in linux - pc file
---------------------------------------

The file named "pc" is a linux (ubuntu or mint) keyboard bindings file which has been modified to change capslock to enter.
The file was originally found at /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc.  
Presumably replacing the existing file with this one will achieve the desired result.

    //    key <CAPS> {      [ Caps_Lock             ]       };
        key <CAPS> {        [ Return                ]       };

After this reload the keyboard map with 

    setxkbmap us

There's a premade pc file in this repo if you don't want to do it yourself.


There are many sections in these files.  The top one appears to bethe default so just modify that one I suppose.

To change other keys modify /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us
then again reload it with setxkbmap us


sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc
check settings
setxkbmap -query
set keyboard map to us
setxkbmap us


In a bash script, to change to the directory of the script

    cd $(dirname $0) 


Miscellaneous make.sh notes 
--------------------------------
Perhaps I should finally learn the make language?

fix linux and windows using different clocks
--------------------------------------------------------
timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock

Linux will no longer apply timezone adjustments to the clock on your motherboard. As a result, the clocks on your dual boot Windows 10 and Linux set up will be in perfect sync. Before you reboot though you should probably make sure it has worked. Just Enter the command below in the Terminal.

timedatectl

Alpine Linux on Virtualbox Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: I have not been able to get audio working on alpine linux in virtualbox 
on a macos host.

 
in system boot order, set hard drive to be the first item
root
setup-alpine
 
vi /etc/apk/repositories # add community repo
apk update
 
adduser nick
visudo # add nick to sudoers
 
install suckless dwm as per this guide
https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Dwm
alt+p is used for the search bar in dwm
 
xrandr -s 1440x900
# The option --size/-s can be used with randr version 1.1 or newer
 
xrandr -s 1440x900
 
alt+shift+q quits dwm
startx starts it again
alt+shift+c closes a window
alt+p opens the "start" menu

Beej's Guide to Socket Programming in C
--------------------------------------------------------------
there's stream sockets and datagram sockets.  they correspond to TCP and UDP respectively
when your program does stuff it'll specify application logic and TCP or UDP or something.  This goes on a header to the Then other systems can take care of the IP layer and the physical layer.
[ ethernet / wifi [ IP (routing) [ TCP [ application_protocol [ THE_ACTUAL_DATA ]  ] ] ] ]
IPv4 addresses have 32 bits  128.0.0.1/30  
CIDR side note: The number can be split up into network and host numbers using the CIDR /30 bit which specifies that the first 30 bits are the network and the last 2 are for the computers on that network.  I suppose this effectively increases the number of network addresses by about 2X.
IPv6 have 128 bits: abc0:ff00::51 
Zeroes can be left out with the double colon notation.
 
Port numbers specify the program or the class of program.  There's established conventions as to which port numbers different programs use.  Ports under 1024 are often considered special, and usually require special OS privileges to use.
 
Big endian is how regular numbers are written
Network Byte Order is big endian
Host Byte Order varies
 
There are functions that convert between these byte orders
short (2 bytes).  long (4 bytes)
htons()  host to network short
 



 
nginx - getting started
--------------------------------------------------------------
static server
Hussein Nasser
http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html
 
On macos put this into /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.  
 
http {
    server {
        listen 8080;
        root /Users/nick/Downloads/code/nginx/;
 
    }
}
 
events { }
 
Change the root directory and put an index.html file in there as well as whatever else you might want.  
 
then run "nginx"
 
then go to "localhost:8080" in a browser
 
:)
 
to stop "nginx -s stop"
to reload the config file "nginx -s reload"
there's plenty of other signals and config files can be much more complicated than this

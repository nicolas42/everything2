	<p>Advanced balloon technology is called rocketry.  Rocket science (engineering) is hard because it's basically about how to sit on top of an explosion. The main problem with our balloon turns out to be the main problem with our rocket. It runs out of gas. If you run out of gas then you might get stuck in empty space. </p>

	<p>If you sit on a chair then you can move by pushing on something else like another person on a chair. Or you could get a fire extinguisher and use it to move. You’ll move in the opposite direction to the thing you were trying to move. It turns out that invisible atoms works like this as well. When the atoms shoot out of the back or the rocket they are coming from a collision that came from a collision that came from a collision that hit the back of your rocket and imparted the same push to you as it got from the explosion. </p>
	
	<p>Balloons work the same way. It goes forwards because the air goes backwards and the little pieces of air all hit each other and the last one hit on the inside of the balloon.  It turns out that the last collision was between the balloon and the last atom. So it’s the thing that actually moves forward. It actually moves forward and hits more air molecules and it will speed them up as it hits them.  </p>
	
	<p>You can hit a hammer on some metal to test this. If they get hot very quickly they’ll go faster and try to fly off in all directions.  If we put a hole in the bottom it’ll fly out backwards and push us forwards.  In fact the rocket is a bit like a very very powerful spray can.  It's made of metal and once you press a button a lot of junk will spray out of it. </p>
	
	<p>It's quite hard to imagine how this actually works because rockets are so much larger and more powerful than things we're used to.  But in addition to the exhaust being essentially a continuous explosion, the weight of the stuff shooting out of the back of the rocket is quite high also.  Here is an example of fuel usage as measured in elephants.</p>

	<h2 id="sidenotewhataboutreallyfastairplanes">Side note: What about really fast airplanes?</h2>
	
	<p>Airplanes move by using big fans to move air.  There's no air in space so they top out at a certain altitude.  You can use a big plane to lift a little rocket up a bit higher but if you want to lift a big rocket you need an even bigger plane and sometimes there just isn't a large enough plane.  Also the main problem is to go fast enough to get into orbit and planes don't solve that.  Not to mention that plane engines won't get you anywhere else in the Solar System.</p>
	
	<h1 id="howtobuildarocket">How to build a rocket</h1>
	
	<p>Here is the essential process of rocket manufacture in the modern world</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>bend some metal into a cylinder shape</li>
	
	<li>weld some spherical bits to the ends</li>
	
	<li>Build two of these, take the end off one and put them together...carefully</li>
	
	<li>Fill one with liquid oxygen</li>
	
	<li>Fill the other with petrol</li>
	
	<li>Pressurize them </li>

	<li>Put a pin in it</li>
	
	<li>Get a long stick and light a match</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Now get out there and see the universe!</p>

Simple examples of OpenCL code
===============================

Simple examples of OpenCL code, which I am using to learn heterogeneous and GPU computing with OpenCL. 

# Examples included

- `add_numbers`: add a list of numbers together. Includes detailed error handling which makes the code harder to read and understand
- `square_array`: computes *array*^2 (I am playing mostly with this one)
- `sum_array`: sums two arrays
- `cf4cl`: testing OpenCL C wrapper
- `Hello_World`: OpenCL "Hello World" by Apple
- `mandelbrot`: my attempt at a simple Mandelbrot set calculation
- `N-BodySimulation`: Apple's N-body simulator which clearly illustrates the speedup gained by using the GPU. Requires Xcode
- `RayTraced_Quaternion_Julia-Set_Example`: Apple
- `rng`: Illustrates how to generate random numbers in the host and in the GPU using the library [`clRNG`](http://clmathlibraries.github.io/clRNG/htmldocs/index.html)
- `auger`: generates random cosmic rays on an isotropic sky

The examples that clearly demonstrate the computational advantage of using a GPU for processing are `N-BodySimulation`, `RayTraced_Quaternion_Julia-Set_Example` (both developed by Apple programmers) and `auger`. For `auger`, I got impressive speedups of >200x compared to a serial code on the CPU.

To install `clinfo` on MacOS:

    brew install homebrew/science/clinfo

# Donate

If you are really happy with these examples, [you can buy me a beer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a0rp5un6ubrkph2/crypto%20wallets.pdf?dl=0). Perhaps I could create a similar repo with CUDA examples?

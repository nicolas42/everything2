OpenCL RayTraced Quaternion Julia-Set Example=============================================# DESCRIPTION:This example shows how to use OpenCL to raytrace a 4d quaternion Julia-Set fractal and intermix the results of a compute kernel with OpenGL for rendering.For theory and information regarding 4d quaternion julia-sets consult the following:http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/fractals/quatjulia/http://www.omegafield.net/library/dynamical/quaternion_julia_sets.pdfhttp://www.evl.uic.edu/files/pdf/Sandin.RayTracerJuliaSetsbw.pdfhttp://www.cs.caltech.edu/~keenan/project_qjulia.htmlNote that the .cl compute kernel file(s) are loaded and compiled atruntime.  The example source assumes that these files are in the same path as the built executable.For simplicity, this example is intended to be run from the command line.If run from within XCode, open the Run Log (Command-Shift-R) to see the output.  Alternatively, run the applications from within a Terminal.app session to launch from the command line.Example downloaded from the [Apple OpenCL Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/opencl/).# BUILD REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.7 or laterThis demo uses float3 vector datatype which is only supported 10.7 and later.# RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.7 or later with OpenCL 1.1# PACKAGING LIST:qjulia.cqjulia.xcodeprojqjulia_kernel.cl# CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:Version 1.0- First version.- - - Copyright (C) 2008 Apple Inc.
